# DeepDisSNP

Identifying disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) remains a key challenge in understanding complex disease genetics. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered many variants, numerous disease–SNP associations remain undiscovered.

In this study, we propose DeepDisSNP, a deep learning framework that integrates SNP linkage disequilibrium (LD) networks and a MeSH-based disease similarity network. Using Graph Attention Networks for representation learning and an MLP classifier for prediction, DeepDisSNP achieves robust performance and identifies biologically meaningful novel associations.
